Content Server and CID Directory Server
    Content Server
        Usage:
            One optional argument - an integer specifying the number of seconds 
            to wait before removing the content, like so
            
            ./ContentServer1 30
            will host the content for 30 seconds
            
            If you leave off the argument, it will host the content indefinitely
            (and the program will immediately quit right away, since it has no
            reason to stay open)
            
        The Content Server currently prints off a list of the CIDs it uploads.
        This is used by the CID Directory Server, but there is really no need 
        for this output file to be generated on the fly each time.
        
        The Makefile will currently spit out 4 Content Server executables.
        All of these will get placed in valid locations in our network
    
    CID Directory Server
        Usage: optionally can specify -v to be verbose
        
        Big Buck Bunny server locations are hard-coded in CidDirectoryServer.cpp
        
        The CID Directory Server must be running before the client, but it does 
        not matter if you start the Content Servers before or after
        
        It reads in its CIDs from output files that are generated by the 
        Content Servers
        
    Ensure you use the make in xsockconf to start the network. Otherwise, these 
    apps will not work! (due to hard-coded content server locations)
