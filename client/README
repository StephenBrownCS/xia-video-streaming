Video Client
    This video client will stream Big Buck Bunny (or any ogg video file) from 
    any content servers which are up and running.
    
    Usage
        Only one optional command line argument:
            -v this triggers verbose mode
            
    Limitations and Known Problems
        The client is set to wait 5 seconds before beginning video playback
    
        Will only work with ogg video theora files
        
        CID Directory Server must be up and running before launching this video client
        If you force quit out of this application while the video is still streaming,
        you will need to restart the XIA network (not sure why)
        
        Application level failover doesn't do anything interesting at the moment
        
        Video plays very choppily when running in the VM. This is because of the 
        many daemons that are running, leaving no idle CPU time.
        
        One of our VM's required the following line to be entered on the command-line
        at the beginning of each testing session:
        
            export LD_PRELOAD=libpulsedsp.so
            
            (Otherwise, an assertion will get triggered in Plogg Ogg Decoder)
            You can also put it in your shell loader file.
        
        Network-level failover last known to work with XIA revision pushed on April 5, 2013.
        It is known to NOT work with the revision posted on April 11, 2013.
        
            How to tell if it's working?
                See our demo video, where we do both scenarios 1 and 3 as described 
                in our paper. When the transfer switches from ContentServer1 to 
                ContentServer3, the correct behavior is that app-level failover
                should NOT kick in. Also, the video should continue when the 
                content server is later restarted.
                
                When attempted to test with the April 11 revision, we found that 
                app-level failover kicks in during the ContentServer switch 
                (indicating that network-level failover did not work)
                and that resuming the video did not work when we powered up
                the content server after being down for a time (unkown reasons).
    
        Must be located in the directory path specified above.
    
        Cannot currently support more than 2 Content Servers running, due to limitation 
        of 4 fallback paths in DAG.

    
    Modules
        VideoClient
            The main class. Just starts the video
            
        PloggOggDecoder
            This is our adaptation of the Plogg video player
            It contains no XIA-specific code, but it is linked to using our 
            XChunkSocketStream specifically.
            
        ChunkFetcher
            This is where all the networking and chunking magic happens
            This runs in its own thread contacting the CID Directory Server 
            for windows of chunks, creating the dags, and requesting chunks
            Application-level failover happens here.
            
        XChunkSocketStream
            This is a wrapper around our ChunkQueue, for use in PloggOggDecoder
            The PloggOggDecoder expectes and istream, and instead of
            going in there and changing things, we decided to make this adapter
            class.
            
        ChunkQueue
            A thread-safe container of chunk pointers. This is what the ChunkFetcher
            fills up and what the XChunkSocketStream empties.
            
        Chunk
            Represents a Chunk
            
        VideoInformation
            A simple struct used by ChunkFetcher to store info about a video
        
        ClientConfig
            This contains many global constants that can and should be tweaked
            
        Utility
            Contains a bunch of utility methods
