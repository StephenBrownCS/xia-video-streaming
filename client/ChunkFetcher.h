/*
    Instances of this class will go out and fetch data. A ChunkFetcher will 
    use the xSocket passed in at construction time to request the CID lists. 
    It will also create its own Chunk Socket to fetch the actual data.

    This class is intended to be used in a multi-threaded context, where one 
    thread fetches the chunks, and another thread "calls in" using 
    getNextChunkFromQueue().
    
    Our handling of application-level failover takes place in this class. 
    Currently it is configured to simply rotate the DAG around (it would be better 
    if it did something like contact the CID Directory server for more 
    content server locations)
